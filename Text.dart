The answer is 1*lets say that X is the number we are searching for.+ So we have X+1=2 and thus by using substraction(adding negative numbers) we obtain the answer: X+1 -1= 2-1"

The thick septum of the heart is not perforated and does not have visible pores as some people thought or invisible pores as Galen thought. The blood from the right chamber must flow through the vena arteriosa (pulmonary artery) to the lungs, spread through its substances, be mingled there with air, pass through the arteria venosa (pulmonary vein) to reach the left chamber of the heart."'
